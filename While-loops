âœ… What is a while loop in Python?
A while loop in Python is used to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is True.

ðŸ§  Syntax:

while condition:
    # code to repeat

Example:

count = 1 #Initial value for the program
while count <= 5: # We giving the condition for the loop 
    print("Count is:", count) # we where printing the statement
    count += 1 # It will increse the value of the count

Output:
Count is: 1
Count is: 2
Count is: 3
Count is: 4
Count is: 5

Appending the item in the List 
Program:

student = ("John Smith") # We where going 
students = [ ]
students.append(student)
print(students)

Output:
['John Smith']
