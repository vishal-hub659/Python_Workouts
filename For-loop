üîÅ What is a for loop in Python?
A for loop is used to iterate (loop) over a sequence like:

a list

a string

a tuple

a dictionary

or even a range of numbers

It lets you run a block of code multiple times, once for each item in the sequence.

üß† Basic Syntax

for variable in sequence:
    # code to run

variable: a temporary name for each item in the sequence

sequence: the data you're looping over (like a list or range)

Example:
In the coding area, we have created a members list. Below that line, write a for-loop block that:

(1) iterates over the items of the members list, and

(2) prints out each item of the list with the first letter capitalized.

 Program:
members = ["john", "sarah", "dora"] # Getting a list from the user
for i in members: # Using the For-loop 
    print(i.title()) # Printing the list of variable as the tiltle 

Match-Case with Bitwise Operator

Example:

Program:
country = "USA"
match country:
    case "USA"|"United States":
        print("Hello")
    case "Italy":
        print("Ciao")
    case "Germany":
        print("Hallo")

Output:
Hello
