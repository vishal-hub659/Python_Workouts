ðŸ“Œ  Lists
A list is a built-in Python data structure that holds an ordered collection of items, which can be of any data type.

ðŸ”¹ Key Characteristics: Defined using square brackets []

Ordered (items have a fixed index)

Mutable (can be changed)

Can hold mixed data types

ðŸ”¹ Use Cases: Storing multiple related values (e.g., list of names)

Iterating over data

Performing batch operations (e.g., sorting, searching)

Example: To create the list of variables

CODE:

firstname = "John"
middlename = "paal"
lastname = "joe"
person=[firstname,middlename,lastname]
print(person)
OUTPUT:
['John', 'paal', 'joe']

ðŸ“Œ Strings
In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed within single ('...'), double ("..."), or triple quotes ('''...''' or """...""").
âœ… Key Points:
Strings can include letters, numbers, symbols, spaces, etc.

Strings are immutable (once created, they cannot be changed).

You can access each character in a string using indexing (my_string[0], my_string[-1]).

You can perform operations like concatenation, slicing, looping, and use string methods like .upper(), .lower(), .replace(), etc.

Example :Write a program that prints out any text in the terminal. It's up to you what string you use inside print().

CODE:

print("Hello, welcome to the world of programming!")

OUTPUT:

Hello, welcome to the world of programming!
