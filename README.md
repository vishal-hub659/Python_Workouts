# Python Fundamentals
ðŸ“Œ 1. Variables
In Python, a variable is a named location used to store data in memory. You can think of it as a "label" for a value. Python is dynamically typed, which means you donâ€™t need to declare a variable type explicitly.

ðŸ”¹ Key Points:
Variables are created when you assign a value to them.

The type of a variable is inferred based on the value assigned.

Variable names must follow naming rules (letters, numbers, underscores, not starting with numbers, etc.).

ðŸ”¹ Why use variables?
Variables help you:

Store data temporarily.

Avoid hardcoding values.

Reuse and update values easily.

Make your code readable and maintainable.
