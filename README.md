# Python Fundamentals
##ðŸ“Œ 1. Variables
In Python, a variable is a named location used to store data in memory. You can think of it as a "label" for a value. Python is dynamically typed, which means you donâ€™t need to declare a variable type explicitly.

ðŸ”¹ Key Points:
Variables are created when you assign a value to them.

The type of a variable is inferred based on the value assigned.

Variable names must follow naming rules (letters, numbers, underscores, not starting with numbers, etc.).

ðŸ”¹ Why use variables?
Variables help you:

Store data temporarily.

Avoid hardcoding values.

Reuse and update values easily.

Make your code readable and maintainable.


##ðŸ“Œ 2. Functions
A function is a block of organized, reusable code that performs a single, related action. Python functions are defined using the def keyword.

ðŸ”¹ Purpose of Functions:
Promote code reuse

Improve organization of logic

Make the code modular and readable

ðŸ”¹ Types of Functions:
Built-in Functions â€“ Like print(), len(), type(), etc.

User-defined Functions â€“ Created using def

Lambda Functions â€“ Anonymous, single-expression functions (using lambda)

ðŸ”¹ Structure of a Function:
def function_name(parameters):
    # block of code
    return value
##ðŸ“Œ 3. Arguments and Parameters
In Python, when a function is called, you can pass values (called arguments) into it. The parameters are the names used in the function definition to accept those arguments.

ðŸ”¹ Types of Arguments:
Positional Arguments â€“ Based on order.

Keyword Arguments â€“ Specified by name.

Default Arguments â€“ Have default values if not provided.

Arbitrary Arguments â€“ Using *args for multiple values.

Arbitrary Keyword Arguments â€“ Using **kwargs for multiple key-value pairs.

ðŸ”¹ Benefits:
Makes functions flexible

Allows customization of behavior

Enhances reusability


##ðŸ“Œ 4. Lists
A list is a built-in Python data structure that holds an ordered collection of items, which can be of any data type.

ðŸ”¹ Key Characteristics:
Defined using square brackets []

Ordered (items have a fixed index)

Mutable (can be changed)

Can hold mixed data types

ðŸ”¹ Use Cases:
Storing multiple related values (e.g., list of names)

Iterating over data

Performing batch operations (e.g., sorting, searching)
